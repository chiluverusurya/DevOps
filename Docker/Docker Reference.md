# Introduction to Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that enables you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within containers. Containers provide a lightweight and isolated environment for running applications, making it easier to package, distribute, and run software across different environments.

In this tutorial, we'll cover the following topics:

1. Installing Docker
2. Working with Docker Images
3. Running Docker Containers
4. Building Custom Docker Images
5. Managing Docker Containers
6. Docker Networking
7. Docker Volumes
8. Docker Compose

Let's get started!

## 1. Installing Docker

To install Docker, follow the instructions provided by Docker for your specific operating system. Docker provides installation packages for Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions.

Once installed, you can verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:

```
docker --version
```

If the installation was successful, you should see the version number of Docker displayed.

## 2. Working with Docker Images

Docker images are the building blocks of containers. They contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

To search for Docker images available on the Docker Hub registry, use the `docker search` command. For example, to search for an Ubuntu image, run:

```
docker search ubuntu
```

To download an image from the Docker Hub, you can use the `docker pull` command followed by the image name and tag. For example, to download the latest Ubuntu image, run:

```
docker pull ubuntu
```

To view the downloaded images on your system, you can use the `docker images` command.

## 3. Running Docker Containers

To run a Docker container, you need to specify which image to use and the command to execute inside the container.

The basic syntax for running a container is:

```
docker run [options] image [command]
```

For example, to run a basic Ubuntu container and start an interactive shell session inside it, run:

```
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

The `-it` option allows you to interact with the container's shell. You can replace `/bin/bash` with any other command you want to execute inside the container.

To detach from a running container without stopping it, you can use the `Ctrl + P + Q` key combination.

## 4. Building Custom Docker Images

You can create your own Docker images by writing a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains instructions for building an image. Here's a basic example:

```Dockerfile
# Use an existing base image
FROM ubuntu

# Run commands inside the container
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

# Set the startup command for the container
CMD ["curl", "https://www.example.com"]
```

Save the above code into a file named `Dockerfile`. Then, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command to build the image:

```
docker build -t my-image .
```

The `-t` option allows you to tag the image with a name. The `.` at the end specifies the build context, which is the current directory.

To run a container from your custom image, you can use the `docker run` command as shown earlier.

## 5. Managing Docker Containers

You can manage Docker containers using various commands. Here are a few useful ones:

- `docker ps`: Lists the currently running containers.
- `docker stop <container_id>`: Stops a running container.
- `docker start <container_id>`: Starts a stopped container.
- `docker restart <

container_id>`: Restarts a running container.
- `docker rm <container_id>`: Removes a stopped container.
- `docker logs <container_id>`: Displays the logs of a container.

## 6. Docker Networking

Docker provides networking capabilities to allow containers to communicate with each other and with the host system. By default, Docker creates a bridge network and assigns IP addresses to containers.

To expose a container's ports to the host system, you can use the `-p` option when running the container. For example:

```
docker run -p 8080:80 my-web-app
```

This maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the container.

## 7. Docker Volumes

Docker volumes provide a way to persist data generated by containers or to share data between containers and the host system. Volumes can be managed using the `docker volume` command.

To create a named volume, run:

```
docker volume create my-volume
```

You can then mount this volume inside a container using the `-v` option when running the container.

## 8. Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the services, networks, and volumes required by your application.

To use Docker Compose, create a `docker-compose.yml` file and define your services. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
```

You can then start your application using the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will build the necessary images and start the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Congratulations! You've learned the basics of Docker. This tutorial only scratches the surface of what Docker can do, but it provides a solid foundation for getting started. Feel free to explore the Docker documentation for more advanced topics and features.
